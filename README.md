This was a simple machine learning project that explores the use of pipelines making the codes more elegant.
My primary goal was to predict the price of houses using the various features
The algorithm I used to solve this problem was linear regression(multiple).
After fitting the model the coefficient of determination was very high on the test data making it a good model for forecast.
Even though I did a little bit of residual diagnotics I still assumed that the fitted model does not violate the assumptions of linear regression 
This because the goal of this simple project was to exploit pipelines
